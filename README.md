# Bookmarks

## User story 

As a user 
So that I can visit my regular web pages faster
Iâ€™d like to be shown a list of my bookmarks

As a user
So that I can have a larger option of bookmarks to choose from
I'd like to be able to add to my list of bookmarks

As a user
So that I can clean up my bookmark options
I'd like to be able to delete bookmarks from my list

As a user 
So that I have freedom to change my mind
I'd like to be able to update my bookmark list
